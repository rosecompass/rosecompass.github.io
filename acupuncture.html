					<h4 class="headerPadding">What is acupuncture?</h4>
					Acupuncture is one modality of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which has been used in prevention and treatment of many conditions for over two thousand years. The medicine is based on the theory that all of nature, including everything from the universe itself to the human body, exists in a balance between opposite yet complimentary forces. Energy in a healthy body flows smoothly through specific pathways, or channels. When there is an energetic imbalance, insufficiency, or blockage in one or more of these pathways, symptoms of disease or pain develop. The goal of an acupuncture treatment is to reestablish a balanced flow of energy throughout the body. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Treatment involves insertion of extremely fine needles at specific points on the body, to unblock and rebalance energy flow, allowing the body to return to its natural and harmonious state of health and well being. The unique power behind this type of medicine comes from its ability to treat an individual person and not a disease or a symptom. Acupuncture stimulates the body’s own natural healing process and without side effects. 

					<h4 class="headerPadding">Western medicine perspective on acupuncture does the following: </h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Promotes blood flow: Everything the body requires to heal is in the blood, including oxygen, nutrients we absorb from food, immune substances, hormones, natural painkillers, and anti-inflammatories. Restoring proper blood flow is vital to promoting and maintaining health.
						</li>
						<li>
							Stimulates the body’s built-in healing mechanisms: Acupuncture creates “micro traumas” that stimulate the body’s ability to spontaneously heal injuries to the tissue through nervous, immune and endocrine system activation. As the body heals the “micro trauma” induced by the needle, it also heals the surrounding tissue damage.
						</li>
						<li>
							Releases natural painkillers: Inserting a needle sends a signal to parts of the brain that are responsible for releasing natural painkilling hormones, such as, neurotransmitters and endorphins.
						</li>
						<li>
							Relaxes injured muscles: This in turn releases pressure on joint structures, nerves, and promotes smooth blood flow.
						</li>
					</ul>
