Based on the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine, where the face reflects the overall balance and health of the entire body.  Acupuncture is known as the medicine that treats the whole person – mind, body and spirit, and Constitutional Facial Acupuncture is not any different.  It will not only addresses the signs of aging and stress that are reflected on the face, it also treats the entire body. Each treatment is individualized to the patient and will include body and facial points as well as Chinese herbal masks and organic moisturizing therapy. 
Fine needles are placed at a variety of acupuncture points on the face, neck and around the eyes to stimulate the body’s natural energies, or Qi. Since muscle groups are addressed as well the acupuncture points, the face lifts itself, via the acupuncture points, through the muscles’ toning and tightening action.  The dual action of needles and the topical application of Chinese herbs help stimulate blood circulation, improve facial color and even out skin irregularities while improving a sense of well-being.

Is Facial Acupuncture for everyone?
For the vast majority of prospective clients, it is a safe and beneficial treatment, not only for prevention of wrinkles but also the reversal of the customary signs of aging.  If you are experiencing any of the following facial acupuncture would not be recommended:
<ul>
	<li>Severe high blood pressure</li>
	<li>Severe migraines</li>
	<li>Pregnancy</li>
	<li>Cold/Flu</li>
	<li>Acute herpes outbreak</li>
	<li>Acute allergic reactions </li>
</ul>  
How Long is the Treatment?
Constitutional Facial Acupuncture™ involves the patient in an organic process, in which a series of treatments is necessary to achieve maximal effect. After an initial session, a practitioner evaluates the patient’s response, and then can determine the number of follow-up visits that will be required:
After this evaluation, and taking into consideration other variables such as stress, diet, lifestyle, genetic inheritance, proper digestion and elimination, sleep, emotional balance, and age, the following durations of treatment are customarily recommended:
<ul>
	<li>Usually 12-15 treatments</li>
	<li>20 treatments for smokers or people whose skin tends to sag, i.e., who manifest jowls, “turkey wattles,” droopy eyes, etc</li>
</ul>
Treatment Timeline:
<ul>
	<li>1 treatment per week, 60 - 90 minutes</li>
</ul>
Maintenance Treatments:
Within the normal parameters of aging, the completion of a series of treatments should be effective. To ensure the persistence of the results, ongoing maintenance treatments are recommended:
<ol>
	<li>Every 2 weeks for 2 months following the completion of a treatment series, then once a month for an indefinite amount of time;</li>
	<li>Of course, the patient can also embark upon a subsequent series after a week’s respite</li>
</ol> 
The Use of Chinese Herbs
The Constitutional Facial Acupuncture™ treatment protocol incorporates Chinese herbal masks, poultices and moisturizers. Jade rollers, which enhance blood circulation, remove fine lines and age spots, and prevent premature aging, are used to massage moisturizer into the skin. The ancient empresses of China used jade as a precious stone to be worn, not only around their necks, but also to attract yin and nourishment into their skin. The stone served a double purpose of promoting beauty and for magical protection.
Short and Long-Term Effects of Facial Acupuncture
After the first treatment, one usually observes an increased glow to the complexion, the result of increased Qi and blood flow to the face. The person’s face appears more “open”, there is a clarity in the eyes, and the patient appears to be more rested; wrinkles start to lessen and the skin appears more toned.
A significant difference in their appearance can be ascertained following the 5th to 7th treatments; even more marked changes in wrinkles, skin tone, etc. The impression of relaxation and calm is more pronounced; they appear as if they have returned from vacation. Lifting of the jowls, neck and the eyes has begun and is usually noticeable. With continuing treatment, constitutional issues like digestive complaints have been ameliorated or subsided.
By the end of a series, the patient should look years younger. These results may vary slightly, depending upon how well the patient has taken care of themselves during the process, and afterward. At this stage, booster treatments provide ongoing support within a normal process of aging.
Constitutional Facial Acupuncture™ is non-invasive, less costly than surgical procedures, and draws upon the ancient Chinese wisdom related to longevity, beauty and balance.
